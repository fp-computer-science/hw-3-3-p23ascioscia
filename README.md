### Chained Conditionals & Logical Operators
---

Answer each of the the following questions in a separate JavaScript file named `hw3-3-#.js` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Be sure to write the program in a way that allows you to swap values to make the program more versatile. (5 pts. each)

1. In order to advance through a locked door, an adventurer character must have a lockpicking level greater than 30, or their luck must be greater than 70. Write a program that uses a conditional to check if the adventurer makes it through the door. If they meet one or both of the conditions, display a message indicating that they made it through the door successfully. If both levels are not high enough, display a message indicating that they do not successfully make it through the door.

2. In an unamed MMORPG, player levels from 1 to 50 are grouped into categories: beginner, low, medium, high, and expert. Levels 1 to 9 are considered beginner, 10 to 19 are low, 20 to 29 are medium, 30 to 39 are high and 40 to 50 are expert. Write a program takes a player's level and uses a chained conditional to display which category they fall under.
